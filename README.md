# bitbar_gdax
Get latest trade prices (in USD) and 24-hour percentage change for BTC, LTC, ETH, and BCH on the GDAX exchange.

## Installation
Download and install [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases/latest).

Open BitBar and select a Plugins Directory.

Drag the `gdax` folder and `gdax.5s.py` file into that directory.

Open `gdax.5s.py` in a text editor and change the first line to match your BitBar Plugins Directory (e.g., `#!/Users/<your username>/Documents/BitBar/gdax/bin/python` if you chose `/Users/<your username>/Documents/BitBar` as your Plugins Directory).

## Donation
If this has saved you some time or helped you catch a good price, feel free to send me crypto. I'll keep developing this as new currencies are added and as I have time to implement new features.
